What happens when you initalize a repository?  Why do you need it?
-->this creates a .git subdirectory in the project root.  This will contain 
all the metadata (previous versions).  You need to do this to start the version
control.

How is the staging area different then the working directory and repository? The value?
--> The staging area is sort of the middle man.  You can "add" files to the staging
area one at a time. And then commit these.  The value is being able to pick and choose
which files to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you only commit 1 logical change?
--> using git diff --staged you can compare the staging area with the latest
commit version.  Looking at the differences you can see the changes.

What are situations where branches would be helpful in keeping history organized? How would
branching help?
-->  Situations like experimenting or eventually needing a slightly different version for varying people.
Kepping this organized this way will make it easier to modifly and go back.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
--> mergine two branches together makes a new whole repositoy on the master.  this preserves the master and
other branch before the merger.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
-->Pro's:  Automatic means you less time merging for you. Cons:  It might not  merge the way you want it to.
